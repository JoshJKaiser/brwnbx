<h2>Our Fold Types</h2>
<p>At Pittsburgh Binding, we offer a variety of fold types to meet all your folding needs. Our most popular fold types include the single fold (also known as the V fold), accordion fold (also known as the Z fold), letter fold (also known as the C fold), gate fold, 1/2 accordion fold, and map fold (also known as the cross fold). Whether you need a simple brochure fold or a complex map fold for your project, we have the expertise and equipment to deliver high-quality and precise results.</p>
<p>Single Fold (V Fold): This type of fold is created by folding the paper in half vertically, creating a simple &quot;V&quot; shape. This is a common fold type used for brochures, flyers, and invitations.</p>
<p>Accordion Fold (Z Fold): The accordion fold is created by folding the paper back and forth in a zigzag pattern, resulting in a &quot;Z&quot; shape. This type of fold is ideal for creating compact and easy-to-carry brochures, product manuals, and maps.</p>
<p>Letter Fold (C Fold): This type of fold involves folding the paper in thirds, creating a &quot;C&quot; shape. This is a popular fold type used for letters, invoices, and statements.</p>
<p>Gate Fold: The gate fold involves folding the paper inwards from both sides towards the center, creating a gate-like opening. This fold type is ideal for creating invitations, newsletters, and product brochures.</p>
<p>1/2 Accordion Fold: This type of fold is created by folding the paper in half horizontally and then folding it in an accordion pattern. It is ideal for creating menus, event programs, and maps.</p>
<p>Map Fold (Cross Fold): The map fold involves folding the paper in half horizontally, and then folding it in half vertically. This results in a &quot;cross&quot; shape and is ideal for creating maps, architectural drawings, and posters.</p>
